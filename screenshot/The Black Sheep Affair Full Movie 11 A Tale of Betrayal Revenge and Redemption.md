## The Plot of The Black Sheep Affair
 
The movie begins with a tense scene where Yim Dong (Vincent Zhao) and his partner Hung Wai-Kwok (Ken Wong) are trying to stop a group of terrorists from hijacking a plane. Yim Dong manages to board the plane and fight off the terrorists, but he also disobeys his commander's orders and causes a lot of collateral damage. As a result, he is demoted and transferred to Lavernia, a small and unstable country in Eastern Europe that is plagued by civil war and corruption.
 
Meanwhile, in Lavernia, a Japanese cult leader named Keizo Mishima (Andrew Lin) is planning to unleash a deadly biological weapon called Tasta on the world. He has a secret base in Lavernia where he conducts experiments on human subjects and develops his weapon. He also has a loyal army of followers who are willing to die for him and his cause.
 
One of Mishima's followers is Chan Pun (Shu Qi), Yim Dong's ex-girlfriend who left China after the Tiananmen Square incident. She joined the cult because she was disillusioned with the world and wanted to find a new purpose in life. However, she soon realizes that Mishima is not the benevolent leader he claims to be, but a ruthless and cruel man who cares nothing for human life.
 
When Yim Dong arrives in Lavernia, he is assigned to protect the Chinese ambassador to Lavernia, Lone Moon (Kenneth Tsang), who is also an old friend of his father. Yim Dong soon finds out that Lone Moon is involved in a secret deal with Mishima, who wants to buy some nuclear materials from him. Yim Dong also encounters Chan Pun, who recognizes him but pretends not to know him.
